# TamuMake

## Overview
When doing certain motions over the Leap Motion sensor, the Beaglebone will receive them as web requests on the server that it is running. On pinching, the Arduino will turn on LEDs relative to high close the two fingers are to each other. A wave will turn off all the LEDS. A fist will send an emergency text to a loved one telling them that you need them.
